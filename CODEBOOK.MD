#Data

The dataset generated by this code is based on the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" V1.0 created by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, at SmartLab, DITEN - Universit√† degli Studi di Genova.
The original source data can be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and contained movement information captured by a smartphone for thirty individuals performing a variety of activities.
This dataset has been modified to group the data by activity, and provide the mean of a subset of only the variables describing a mean or standard deviation.

#Variables

activity: the activity performed by the participants

All other variables represent either the mean of the mean (mean - e.g. mean_of_tGravityAcc.meanY) or of the standard deviation(std - e.g. mean_of_tBodyAcc.stdZ) of one of the following measurements:

- tBodyAcc-XYZ
- tGravityAcc-XYZ
- tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
- tBodyGyro-XYZ
- tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
- tBodyAccMag
- tGravityAccMag
- tBodyAccJerkMag
- tBodyGyroMag
- tBodyGyroJerkMag
- fBodyAcc-XYZ
- fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
- fBodyGyro-XYZ
- fBodyAccMag
- fBodyAccJerkMag
- fBodyGyroMag
- fBodyGyroJerkMag

#Data Manipulation

The original data was maniuplated in the following ways:
- The activity labels, the variable labels, and the data were combined into a object for both the "train" and "test" datasets, and then appended to each other
- The activity labels were renamed from ID numbers to their descriptive names, and the variable labels were cleaned so that they could be properly processed in R
- The data was grouped by activity, and then the average for each measurement was produced for every activity
- The variable labels were amended with the prefix "mean_of" to denote their new content, and were cleaned of any artifacts and stray characters leftover from the processing
